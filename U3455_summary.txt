[Music]
learning something new every single day
for a week seems fun why not to impress
my son that's the reason why yes the
first thing I wanted to learn was how to
spin a frisbee on my finger it turns out
that's a lot harder than I thought it
was so on day one I tried it out it
didn't go well crispy how hard can it be
it comes with a little bag which I'll
never ever use nice attempt number one
this will be the
Benchmark attempt number
[Music]
two this might be a little harder than I
thought
apparently I was spinning it the wrong
way I was spinning it this way but
you're supposed to spin it towards you
it kind of helps to look at it from the
top like this cuz then you can see how
it spins and get a feel for it and then
you kind of Imagine drawing a circle
with your finger I'm still kind of
learning it but it's definitely first
time I see an improvement I'm just going
to keep practicing this until be is
satisfying it's a lot harder than I
thought all right Mar say's trying how
are you better than me the first
[Music]
time I know why cuz you have the dough
the past the pizza dough fil an
instinct okay maybe
[Music]
not am I boring you
[Music]
really the reason I wanted wanted to
learn this was because when I was a kid
my dad knew how to do this and I thought
that was the coolest thing ever I even
told all my friends that hey my dad can
spin a frisbee on his finger isn't that
awesome I just thought it was so cool
that Legacy has to live on I had to
learn how to spin a frisbe on my
finger I practiced this a lot and I
actually did this throughout the entire
week for 10 minutes outside cuz BJ liked
being outside and he liked watching me
do it I think it's cuz it's so bright
[Music]
colored that was a good
[Music]
one the trick is to spin it like here I
started like here so you kind of want to
work your way around here and I think
the problem I had was you sort of
instinctively move your whole arm but
then you it starts wobbling and you lose
balance so you really want to try and
just like focus on keeping traction on
your fingers and the more you do it the
more you sort of get control and you
understand when you can apply Force to
keep it spinning I'm still working it
out but that's what I got so far all
right let's try the pillow
[Music]
today
[Music]
the final
challenge yeah new skill
online you know I practice stuff that
requires hand condemnation before and
generally what you want is to just
practice a
lot for for many different
days yeah I find it really interesting
just how just sleeping you know just do
a little bit rest and then come back and
then magically you're better how does
that work brain subconscious be like
bruh I would actually love to do this
kind of thing again where I practice
something maybe for 10 minutes and see
what kind of result you can get I just
find that interesting
anyway I bet you're sitting here
thinking I wish I could learn something

should I learn today and she came up
with baking I don't bake sorry I know
how to make Swedish pancakes and Swedish
KCK bread I'd say this is a really tough
challenge out of my comfort zone but I
think in the end it went pretty
[Music]

water 51 this is going to nail
it 39 good enough okay so first we take
a small bowl milk and water and the
yeast I feel like you shouldn't mix
those things that's a little
cursed this feels like a lot of yeast
and then I'm supposed to leave it for 2
minutes and then we grab a big bowl and
we enter all the stuff on the left side
which is the flour and the why
don't use use Des as since we done 200 g
this seems like a lot of flour I feel I
if you weren't here I'd be like this is
wrong in the Big Bowl what was that salt
so this is salt 15 G this is sugar 15
and then finally the salt which is only
3
G not that much sugar
salt so this is making dough I'm making

hello I am a moose remember to also
visit your Homeland
Sweden and because we have moose like me
here and it's very good we have really
really good meatballs I think you're
going to like the meatballs be although
we can make meatballs here from Japan as
well um well uh it's been a pleasure to
say hi to you be I forget to
speak does it look
like oh yes I am of
course
day four day four was a bit random
because I wasn't planning to do it but
we were heading out to try out one of
those trampoline parks and I thought
perfect chance for me to finally finally
learn how to do a front flip I can't do
a front flip I never done one I don't
know how to do one but uh I asked the
person that worked there if he could uh
sort of instruct teach me how to do it
and you do it in succession so first you
kind of do a sum salt with uh with your
hands then you do a suult without your
hands uh on a mattress then you try and
do a whole flip without your
hands and then so on and so forth so
it's kind of you take the steps up and
[Music]
yeah
after all that I could do it and it's
cool I can do it all my friends could do
front flips I could never do front flip
now I can do front flip I realized it's
less cool when you're 32 years old but
hey I know how to do a front
flip day five was actually a huge
failure because I was planning to do
something else it already takes up a lot
of time to have a child right now and uh
I only had so much time every single day
to practice one of these things and what
I was planning to do failed completely
so I needed to improvise and therefore I
decided to learn 3D printing except I
already know how to 3D
print we have this little play pen for
bejn and we realize that the it's so
humid in Japan that the ropes were
becoming moldy so I decided I was going
to replace them with something even
cooler than a bunch of stupid geometric
shapes philosophers I PL printed out
Plato Socrates and senaka I was going to
do diogenes but I couldn't find a 3D cat
and I I'm sure as hell not going to
model one myself the result however was
spectacular and I know B is going to
love it so we're going to replace these
but with my 3D prints we got Socrates we
got Playdoh we got
Sena it's going to be beautiful I'm not
going to try and influence you in any
way be like you'll pick the stuff that
you like and you enjoy but also I
apologize about
this it's not a dog toy it's human
toy this is
ridiculous this is just a joke I'm not
going to actually keep these I don't
even know if this type of plastic is
safe for children I just did it and
there's the result there you go
V he loves it but it does look great
they do look very creepy also did a
dumbbell which just pretty cool no as I
was filming it broke what I have this
for you there we go that's my boy right
there I'm not trying to steer my child
in any form of Direction whatever he
will enjoy he will enjoy but
also day six my God learning something
for every single day for this long it
was getting kind of tough I'm not going
to lie but if you want to impress your
child everyone knows the one thing you
brag about when you're a kid is that my
dad can beat up your dad he's way
stronger than your dad or he works at
Nintendo and he can beat up your dad so
I wanted to learn how to do a one arm
push-up my dad can beat up your dad oh
yeah well can your dad do a one arm
push-up cuz my dad can do that I tried
this before and I failed spectacularly
spectacularly
spectacular oh no spectacular
spectacular if I twist my body it's
actually quite easy I can do it my with
my left hand let's try that with the
right I feel like that doesn't count but
it turns out there's a trick to it all
you have to do is separate your legs to
maintain a balance and that's it it's
actually kind of easy I wasn't even sure
if I did it right because it's so easy
but hey I learn how to do one hour
pushup day seven of learning something
new every single day finally the last
day and oh boy that I Sav the hardest
one for last suing sewing suing I'm not
suing you I'm sowing you I'm sewing I
suck at sewing I never sewed I sewed in
second grade I was so bad at this I was
it was genuinely stressing me out and oh
boy did I over complicate it so we just
need to do
this I wanted to make a wizard hat for
be it was so hard I don't know why it
was so hard I felt very dumb and stupid
and I overthought the entire process
hello it's the last day which I'm
actually kind of relieved About Me and
Mar went out to get some fabric and she
show me the ropes we'll see how this
goes I have not
sewn since second grade so I need a
circumference of 10 cm that's a tiny
head so I'm going to try and draw Circle
by using this
method
that's the roundest circle on the planet
right there I'm just making stuff up
here and my did not tell me to do this I
hope the felt Community is not watching
this seems like the kind of community
you don't want to piss off so now I got
to do my third grade math and calculate
the circumference okay that's almost as
big as the felt itself is that so 34.5
maybe
35.5 okay oh it's going to be so cute
that's a very tall hat though now that
I'm looking at it yeah I'll make it tall
it's really scary to do stuff for the
first time I don't have the confidence
and I also don't have the extra fabric
so this has to work this actually
reminds me when I was a kid my mom made
me a strawberry hat a little strawberry
hat and I was so proud of it so a nice
little homage to my mom as well here and
not just my frisbey spinning Dad
hopefully will love it he won't remember
it but hey probably could have drawn
this more towards the
edge I realized I'm very dumb I already
knew this this is where the head's
supposed to be uh this is more what I
was yeah this will work that was a lot
harder than I thought it was but it's
shaping up the way I want it to oh yeah
it's time to sew I feel like I already
messed this up I'm going to have to
improvise a little bit
[Music]
here let's redo that all I needed to
take a break to actually figure this out
my diameter is 136 my radius 68 we have
a circle and I want to make like uh
120° this is the area I need C2 is
427 26 then that means so we just need
to do this divided with
two pi r no that's not what I want to do
pi r i want to calculate so just divide
it by two and Pi that's all I needed to
do okay I shamefully had to sue a bunch
of stuff together because I yeah I just
messed up so bad but now I'm finally in
the sewing properly
face this thing
looks
horrible I'm so done I hate
God it's so bad it's cute
hey yeah hey but in the end Mara came to
save me when I had given up she said she
did 1% out of 99% but I think it was
more like 10 at least 10% I needed
backup that looks so much better now but
honestly as stressful and horrible as it
was seeing be wearing the wizard hat it
made it worth it it was extremely
cute
it's so big I made it a little bigger on
purpose but I didn't think it was that
much bigger that was so much harder than
I thought but we got there in the end
with a Little Help from R it was worth
it just to see him in the Hat to be
honest oh wow it works for the dogs
too no oh my goodness oh but
yeah final challenge completed so there
we go I learned something new every day
for a week but I also bonus learned that
learning new things is very fun and
satisfying not just so you can be that
cool dad who can spin a fris on his
hands you know but it genuinely feels
very satisfying and I do think just
practicing something for a small portion
every single day can actually have
pretty significant results if you just
want to learn the basics obviously so I
challenge you hey learn something new I
wouldn't pick seven things just pick one
thing that's that's a smart thing to do
yeah
if you want a weird and stressful but
genuinely fun and memorable week while
doing something different I recommend it
hope you guys enjoyed this video I had a
lot of fun making it and I see you guys
in the next one
byebye he's strong as hell be that's
going to be at least 20
lbs
