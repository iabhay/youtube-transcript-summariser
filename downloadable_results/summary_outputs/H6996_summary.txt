hello mr rashid hi how are you fine
thank you how was your vacation it was
wonderful i'm so happy to hear that was
your flight okay no pretty bad actually
it was so bumpy it was very scary
that's too bad
did you have nice weather after you
arrived no the weather was terrible very
rainy i actually never saw the sun
that's awful
so what did you do i stayed inside the
hotel
was the hotel room nice the room was
fine but it was right next to the cafe
and the music was very loud i didn't
sleep much
i'll bet the food was great no it was
too salty for me and the waiters were
very unfriendly did you go shopping at
all a little bit until someone stole my
wallet after that i stayed in the hotel
and read a book
was the flight home okay actually they
cancelled my flight i had to stay for
two more days
that's
terrible but mr rashid you said that
your vacation was wonderful yes i did
and it was wonderful i met a very nice
person a woman actually her name is
basmar she's from lebanon just like me
but she lives here i'm seeing her
tonight so yes it was a wonderful
vacation that's great mr rashid
[Music]
yes
mr rasheed welcome back
come tell me about your vacation
what a terrible vacation mr rashid had
oh
you know
on my vacation last year someone stole
my car
that was a horrible vacation
i went on a cruise and there was an
outbreak of illness i was in my room for
a week
that was a really bad vacation i went to
disney world and someone stole my map
that's
your worst vacation
it took 10 minutes to get another map
all right
what was your favorite vacation
i spent two weeks in the caribbean last
year diving snorkeling and swimming with
dolphins it was amazing
i went to china a few years ago
it was incredible the people there were
so friendly and everyone wanted to
practice their english with me
i went to the beach
and ate shrimp
that's your best vacation
i really like
shrimp you need to go on more exciting
vacations i don't like exciting
vacations in fact i don't like to travel
very much
then
why do you work in a travel agency it's
across the street from my apartment
so i don't have to travel far to go to
work
so mrs beatty we should talk about your
safari trip to botswana
i'm so excited my first time in africa
you're going to be flying into
johannesburg south africa
would you like a window or an aisle a
window i want to see everything
in johannesburg you should take a taxi
or a limo to your hotel
the next day you could fly or you could
take a train to france's town in
botswana
is it an express train
yes
i'll take the train i'd like to see the
country great
then after you see francis town you can
take a small plane or a bus to the
okavanga delta
how small is the airplane it's pretty
small
i'll take the bus
is it an express bus
i think so
when you get to gomari you're going to
be taking a boat to your hotel
a boat the hotel is on an island
when you get to the island a man with a
donkey can take your luggage to the
hotel
a donkey
there are no cars on the island
is it an express donkey
i think it's probably a local donkey
of course if you don't want the donkey
you could take a small plane it goes
straight to the hotel
i think i should take the donkey
donkeys never have mechanical problems
right right
[Music]
so many people do it all over south
africa hello mrs baby why hello paul
where are you traveling to now mrs
beatty is going on a safari in the
okavanga delta in botswana nice
are you flying in are you taking the
train bus boat dunky route
i'm going to be taking the donkey i did
that once myself you did was it very
exciting oh it was on the way there the
plane had mechanical problems
that sounds scary we got in late
and i missed the train to francis town
so i decided to take a bus
but i got on the local bus by mistake
i don't like local buses
then the bus had an accident
so i rented a car
but it broke down
oh dear i got to gomari two days late
then i got seasick on the boat to the
island oh my
did you have any problems with the
donkey i got bumped from the dump
